cbinder
=======
``cbinder`` generates ctypes bindings for DLLs directly from H files. It provides an extensible and 
hookable architecture to accommodate the wide range of requirements of real-life libraries. 
``cbinder`` works at the source level (before preprocessing) and contains a minimal preprocessor
of its own, which enables it to expose constants and other macros to Python.

``cbinder`` was originally developed for [PrimeSense](http://www.primesense.com/) as part of the 
[OpenNI2 Python Wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/primesense) and kindly released by them as an 
open source project for the benefit of the community
